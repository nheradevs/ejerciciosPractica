1. Create an online banking system with the following features:

* Users must be able to log in with a username and password.
* If the user enters the wrong credentials three times, the system must lock them out.
* The initial balance in the bank account is $2000.
* The system must allow users to deposit, withdraw, view, and transfer money.
* The system must display a menu for users to perform transactions.

// Declare variables
string username, password
loginAttemps = 0
balance = 2000
menu = ""

// Login loop
while true
    write "Enter your username"
    read username
    write "Enter your password"
    read password

        // Verify credentials
        if verifyCredentials (username, password)
            write "Login successful"
            break
        else
            loginAttemps++
            write "Wrong credentials"
            if loginAttemps >=3
                write "You are blocked"
                exit
            end if
        end if
end while

// Program loop
while true
    write "This is your balance"
    write balance + "$"

    write "Select your option"
    write "1. Deposit"
    write "2. Withdraw"
    write "3. View"
    write "4. Transfer money"
    read menu
end while

 // User choice
    switch choice
        option 1:
            write "Enter amount to deposit:"
            real depositAmount
            read depositAmount
            balance = balance + depositAmount
            write "Deposit successful! New balance: $" + balance
        option 2:
            write "Enter amount to withdraw:"
            real withdrawAmount
            read withdrawAmount
            if withdrawAmount > balance
                write "Insufficient funds"
            else
                balance = balance - withdrawAmount
                write "Withdrawal successful! New balance: $" + balance
            end if
        option 3:
            write "Your balance is: $" + balance
        option 4:
            write "Enter destiny account"
            read destinyAccount
            write "Enter amount"
            read amount
            // Transfer
            transfer(destinyAccount, amount)
        default:
            write "Invalid choice"
    end switch
