5. Turkish Airlines has just launched an offer to travel among the following destinations: Turkey, Greece, Lebanon, Spain, and Portugal. Develop an algorithm with the following characteristics:
It must have a login and validate the data; after the third failed attempt, it should be locked.
The user must choose the origin country and the destination country, the flight date, and the condition: Economy or First Class.
The user must choose if they want to check an additional piece of luggage into the hold.
Hand luggage is free of charge.
The user must purchase both the outbound and return tickets.
The user can choose their preferred meal: Regular, Vegetarian, Kosher.
The program must collect the following data: Name, country of origin, passport, and destination country.
Upon completing the process, the system will display everything the user has previously chosen along with their information. 
The system will provide the option to confirm the reservation or cancel it. If the user chooses YES, a confirmation message will appear. If not, it will return to the main menu.
