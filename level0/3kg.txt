3. Create an university enrollment system with the following characteristics:
* 		The system has a login with a username and password.
* 		Upon logging in, a menu displays the available programs: Computer Science, Medicine, Marketing, and Arts.
* 		The user must input their first name, last name, and chosen program.
* 		Each program has only 5 available slots. The system will store the data of each registered user, and if it exceeds the limit, it should display a message indicating the program is unavailable.
* 		If login information is incorrect three times, the system should be locked.
* 		The user must choose a campus from three cities: London, Manchester, Liverpool.
* 		In London, there is 1 slot per program; in Manchester, there are 3 slots per program, and in Liverpool, there is 1 slot per program.
* 		If the user selects a program at a campus that has no available slots, the system should display the option to enroll in the program at another campus.

// Declare variables

// Login loop
while true
    write "Enter your username"
    read username
    write "Enter your password"
    read password

    // Verify credentials
    if verifyCredentials (username, password)
        write "Login successful"
        break
    else
        loginAttemps++
        write "Wrong credentials"
        if loginAttemps >= 3
            write "You are blocked"
            exit
        end if
    end if
end while

// Program loop
while true
    write "Select available programs"
    write "Computer Science"
    write "Medicine"
    write "Marketing"
    write "Arts"

    write "Enter your first name"
    read first name
    write "Enter your last name"
    read last name
    write "Enter your program"
    read program

    write "Select your campus"
    write "London"
    write "Manchester"
    write "Liverpool"
    read campus
